                        the reason my team and I believe that ModVision would be a great tool for hearing or vision impaired people. For this project, I created a mobile application prototype on Axure that would be able to connect, control and customise
                        the glasses. For the research part, we analysed features offered by similar systems while we also reached out to prospective users using online platforms. For the testing and evaluation of the project we used UX experts, the Wizard
